I'm a software engineer at FreeAgent where I'm using my pre-coding career experience to build software for accountants. 

After finishing my coding bootcamp at Makers, I spent 2 years honing my skills at the V&A Museum in London, spending most of my time on Rails, Python, FastAPI and elasticsearch while we transformed the online collections site, then I moved to the amazing team at Zombies, Run! (Six to Start) where I worked mainly with Python and React. Previously I was a technical accountant in the NHS (costing and income), I have a passion for health and fitness. I'm a blogger and a learner and I like to share cool tips on my blogs. Techy faff on [whatapalaver](https://whatapalaver.co.uk/), Excel skills on [NHS Excel](http://nhsexcel.com/) and [Excel Pivots](http://excelpivots.com/).

- Latest personal project is [BHG - Bridge Hand Generator](http://www.remotebridge.co.uk), designed to allow our Bridge Club to continue playing remotely during the big C lockdown era. Built in Rails.
- Notable public work projects are the release of [Explore the Collections](https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/digital/announcing-explore-the-collections) and the reaunch of Zombies, Run! as [ZRX.app](https://zrx.app/)
- Most active with: `python`, `ruby`, `django`, `ruby on rails`, `elasticsearch`, `docker` and `bash`
