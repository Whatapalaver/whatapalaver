## Hi 👋 I'm Angela

I'm a fullstack developer at the V&A Museum in London, where I've been since the beginning of 2019, having completed a coding bootcamp at Makers.

- 📊&nbsp;&nbsp; Really keen to improve my coding skills so I often take part in coding challenges, complete tracks at exercism.io and dabble with personal projects
- 👨🏽‍💻&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently working, learning and growing my skillset in data structures and algorithms as the latest round of Advent of Code showed me to be lacking in my CS foundations.
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp; Most active with: `python`, `ruby`, `ruby on rails`, `elasticsearch`, `docker` and `bash`
- 📫&nbsp;&nbsp; How to reach me via [email], [twitter], [blog] or [linkedin].
